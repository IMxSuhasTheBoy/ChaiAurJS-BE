# javascript and classes

## OOP

just an programming paradime ( personal structure/style of coding )

## Object - base unit

- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP

(can be a spaghetti code solution for some cases, such as java feature: services)

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
  > 1. new keyword creates an empty Object as soon as it's defined for creating the instance.
  > 2. calls the constructor func, includes args in instance.
  > 3. inserters the properties in Object that this keyword is referencing.
  > 4. we get a uniqe instance from constructor func.

## 4 pillars

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

If you're coming from a JavaScript background and want to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and how they are implemented in JavaScript, here are some suggestions for further learning and practice:

1. **Prototype-based inheritance**: Since JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance rather than class-based inheritance, it's essential to understand how prototypes work and how objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. You can practice by creating objects, defining methods on their prototypes, and exploring the prototype chain.

2. **Constructor functions**: Practice creating constructor functions and using them to instantiate objects. Experiment with different ways of defining and initializing properties and methods within constructor functions.

3. **Prototypal inheritance patterns**: Explore various patterns for implementing inheritance in JavaScript, such as the prototypal inheritance pattern, factory functions, and mixins. Compare their advantages and disadvantages and understand when each pattern is appropriate.

4. **ES6 classes**: While JavaScript's class syntax is just syntactic sugar over prototype-based inheritance, understanding how it works and its similarities to traditional class-based languages can be beneficial. Practice using ES6 classes to define objects and their behavior.

5. **Encapsulation and abstraction**: Experiment with encapsulating data and behavior within objects to create more modular and maintainable code. Practice using closures, private variables, and privileged methods to achieve encapsulation.

6. **Design patterns**: Explore common design patterns used in object-oriented programming, such as the singleton pattern, factory pattern, observer pattern, and module pattern. Understand how these patterns can be implemented in JavaScript and when to use them.

7. **Refactoring**: Practice refactoring existing code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. Look for opportunities to apply object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to make the code more expressive and reusable.

8. **Code reviews and collaboration**: Participate in code reviews and collaborate with other developers to gain insights into different approaches to object-oriented design and implementation. Learn from others' code and share your knowledge and experiences with the community.

By practicing these concepts and techniques, you'll develop a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript and become a more proficient and versatile JavaScript developer.
