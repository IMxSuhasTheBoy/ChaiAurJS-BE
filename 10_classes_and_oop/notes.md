# javascript and classes

## OOP

just an programming paradime ( personal structure/style of coding )

## Object - base unit

- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP

(can be a spaghetti code solution for some cases, such as java feature: services)

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
  > 1. new keyword creates an empty Object as soon as it's defined for creating the instance.
  > 2. calls the constructor func, includes args in instance.
  > 3. inserters the properties in Object that this keyword is referencing.
  > 4. we get a uniqe instance from constructor func.
